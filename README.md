# STOCK VOLATILITY PREDICTION USING GARCH

First, I'll delve into the intricacies of stock data for two specific companies, leveraging the comprehensive AlphaVantage stock API. This exploration will involve gathering, analyzing, and understanding various facets of the financial information available.

Next, armed with the acquired stock data, I'll embark on the challenging task of calculating volatility—a crucial metric in the dynamic realm of financial markets. The volatility calculation will be a meticulous process, involving statistical methods to gauge the degree of variation in stock prices.

Subsequently, I'll channel my efforts towards constructing a robust predictive model that aims to forecast future stock volatility. This model will harness the insights gained from the earlier data exploration, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and trends.

Finally, I'll transition to the deployment phase, where I take pride in creating a personalized API. This API will not only encapsulate the predictive power of the developed model but also serve as a platform to share real-time predictions. The deployment process involves ensuring seamless integration, testing for reliability, and making the predictive power of the model accessible to users. This endeavor marks the culmination of the entire workflow, transforming theoretical insights into a practical and valuable tool for stock market prediction.

Volatility models are used in econometrics and financial engineering. Also, this project uses time series data.

Once you complete this project, you'll be able to:
<ul>
    <li>Get data from a web API by making HTTP requests.</li>
    <li>Transform and load data to a SQL database using custom Python classes.</li>
    <li>Calculate asset volatility and build a GARCH model to predict it.</li>
    <li>Build web API and server to serve model’s predictions.</li>
</ul>
